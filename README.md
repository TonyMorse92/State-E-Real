# State-E-Real
An attempt to make an end-to-end data processing project. 
Goal is to simulate data, store it (on Cloud?), make an API, consume the data through an endpoint, and have a visualization.

Going to start with simulating the data. As the name may suggest, going to be real estate data. Not sure what specifically yet (have been looking at some mortgage trading, but might just do price data).
